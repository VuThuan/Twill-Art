 * Safari recognizes both, but the only one that actually makes
 * it do something is `-webkit-optimize-contrast`. However, we
 * probably don't want to use it here, because Safari's algo is
 * nearest neighbor. Possibly with an additional unsharp mask.
 * It looks *really* bad. By overriding it with `optimizequality`,
 * we make it do nothing.
