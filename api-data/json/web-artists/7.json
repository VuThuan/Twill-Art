Born in Florence to American parents, he lived abroad, traveling the world in search of his subjects and working professionally for more than 50 years.</p><p>Sargent first exhibited at the Art Institute\u2014at the time located at Michigan Avenue and Van Buren Street\u2014in 1890, drawing crowds of visitors to the museum and helping to put Chicago on the map as a recognized center for contemporary art and culture.
