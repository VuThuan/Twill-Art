The curatorial and conservation entries, which include new high-resolution photography, draw fascinating connections between Pissarro\u2019s life and work, and offer novel insights into his technique, showing how he consistently pushed Impressionist approaches in new directions.   Edited by Gloria Groom and Genevieve Westerby; essays by Richard R. Brettel, Kelly Keegan, Kimberly Nichols, and Kirk Vuillemot   The Pissarro project has received generous funding from the Mellon Foundation as well as the Art Institute\u2019s David and Mary Winton Green Nineteenth-Century Research Fund.
