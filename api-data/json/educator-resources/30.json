    "copy": " Adriaen van Ostade's Merrymakers in an Inn illustrates peasants of multi-generations celebrating a joyous event in a spacious and picturesque interior. In the 17th century, the inn served as a humble center for peasant revelry in the Dutch Republic and Ostade took special interest in the colorful, compelling activities shared in these establishments. This teaching packet includes an essay, discussion questions, activity ideas, a glossary, and an image of the artwork. ",
