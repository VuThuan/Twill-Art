    "copy": " Art + Science was developed by the Art Institute of Chicago to support dialogue and collaboration between art and science teachers at the middle school level, with the ultimate goal of inspiring art and science integration in the curriculum. The program consists of two interconnected parts: this curriculum resource and a field trip to the museum, which features a gallery tour and studio art-making activity. The curriculum resource is intended to help teachers to prepare for and extend the field trip experience. Both the field trip and curriculum resource showcase and encourage interdisciplinary connections between art and science first on a broad level and then through the particular lens of stability and change.
